# Getting Started with PanOS

## What is PanOS?

PanOS is a minimal, from-scratch Linux operating system specifically designed for JavaScript developers. It combines:

- **Linux Kernel 6.6.15** - Custom compiled for minimal footprint
- **Node.js v24.0.0** - Integrated as the primary runtime
- **npm** - Package manager pre-installed
- **Busybox 1.35** - Complete Unix toolset
- **QEMU Compatible** - Runs in virtual machines instantly
- **Bootable ISO** - Can be installed on physical hardware

The entire system fits in ~160 MB and boots in seconds.

## Why PanOS?

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Minimal** | No unnecessary packages, pure Linux |
| **Fast** | Boots in 3-5 seconds |
| **Complete** | All tools you need to run Node.js apps |
| **Hackable** | Source code available, fully customizable |
| **Educational** | Learn kernel compilation, system design, OS fundamentals |

## 30-Second Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (one time, requires sudo)
./0-install-deps.sh

# 2. Build PanOS (20-30 minutes)
./1-build.sh

# 3. Run in QEMU
./2-run.sh
```

That's it! You'll see a shell prompt ready to run Node.js.

## What Happens After Build?

Once you see the prompt:

```bash
/ #
```

You can immediately run:

```bash
# Check Node.js
node --version           # v24.0.0
npm --version            # 10.x.x

# Run JavaScript
node -e "console.log('Hello from PanOS!')"

# Create a project
npm init -y
npm install express      # install packages

# Run the boot script
node boot.js

# List available commands
ls /bin                  # hundreds of busybox commands
```

## Exiting PanOS

Press **Ctrl+A** then **X** to exit QEMU and return to your terminal.

## System Requirements

Your host machine needs:

- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian-based Linux
- **RAM**: Minimum 4 GB (recommended 8 GB)
- **Disk Space**: 30 GB free (kernel compilation needs space)
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (build uses all cores)
- **Time**: 20-30 minutes for first build

## What's in the Build?

After running `./1-build.sh`, you get:

```
~/pan-os-iso/build/
├── vmlinuz              # Linux kernel (~3.3 MB)
├── initramfs.cpio       # Root filesystem (~140 MB)
└── pan-os-booteable.iso # Bootable ISO (~156 MB)
```

These files are:
- **vmlinuz**: The compiled Linux kernel
- **initramfs.cpio**: Complete filesystem with Busybox + Node.js
- **ISO**: For booting on physical machines

## Validation

After build completes, check status:

```bash
./3-check.sh
```

This validates:
- ✅ Kernel present
- ✅ Initramfs created
- ✅ Node.js integrated
- ✅ npm included
- ✅ ISO ready

## Next Steps

1. **Learn the Prerequisites** → Read `02-prerequisites.mdx`
2. **Deep Dive into Build Process** → Read `04-building.mdx`
3. **Understanding Architecture** → Read `06-architecture.mdx`
4. **Advanced Customization** → Read `10-advanced.mdx`

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"Command not found"** | Run `./0-install-deps.sh` first |
| **"Disk space error"** | Need 30+ GB free; clear space or use external drive |
| **"Build fails at kernel"** | Try again; sometimes network timeouts occur |
| **QEMU won't start** | Ensure `qemu-system-x86_64` is installed |

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I boot PanOS on real hardware?**  
A: Yes! Use `./4-create-iso.sh` to create an ISO, then burn to USB with `dd` command.

**Q: How long does build take?**  
A: 20-30 minutes on a modern 4-core machine. Faster on higher core counts.

**Q: Can I modify the source?**  
A: Absolutely. All scripts are editable. See `10-advanced.mdx` for customization.

**Q: What if build fails halfway?**  
A: Run `./1-build.sh` again. It will resume from where it failed.
